# Fabcoin GPU mining 

# Why Equihash?


we have started using Equihash as the proof-of-work for block mining in Fabcoin .

Equihash is a Proof-of-Work algorithm devised by Alex Biryukov and Dmitry Khovratovich. It is based on a computer science and cryptography concept called the Generalized Birthday Problem.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equihash

# WHY ARE WE USING IT?
Equihash has very efficient verification. This could in the future be important for light clients on constrained devices, or for implementing a Fabcoin client inside Ethereum (like BTC Relay, but for Fabcoin ).

Equihash is a memory-oriented Proof-of-Work, which means how much mining you can do is mostly determined by how much RAM you have. We think it is unlikely that anyone will be able to build cost-effective custom hardware (ASICs) for mining in the foreseeable future.

We also think it is unlikely that there will be any major optimizations of Equihash which would give the miners who know the optimization an advantage. This is because the Generalized Birthday Problem has been widely studied by computer scientists and cryptographers, and Equihash is close to the Generalized Birthday Problem. That is: it looks like a successful optimization of Equihash would be likely also an optimization of the Generalized Birthday Problem.

Nevertheless, we canâ€™t know for certain that Equihash is safe against these issues, and we may change the Proof-of-Work again, if we find some flaw in Equihash or if we find another Proof-of-Work algorithm which offers higher assurance.

# HOW CAN I MINE?
The same way as before! Just add gen=1 to your config file, or run ./src/fabcoindd -gen, this will start cpu mining process. And for better result, should choose GPU mining. 

   
## GPU mining hardware requirement  

We developed GPU mining in OpenCL and Ubuntu 16.04 system, and has been tested on AMD Rx480 and Nvidia 1080 graphic card , it could used on other graphic card which support OpenCL and in other OS envirment. 
 

## Graphic card driver and OpenCl installation

### Configure 
 
Ensure that your user account is a member of the "video" group prior to using the  driver. You can find which groups you are a member of with the following command:

$ groups
           
To add yourself to the video group you will need the sudo password and can use the following command:

$ sudo usermod -a -G video $LOGNAME 

You will need to log out and in again to activate this change.

### Install graphic card driver and Open CL
OpenCL support comes with the graphic card driver. Please check your graphic card vendor website, and found out how to install your   graphic card driver and Open Cl.

Read the appropriate subsection below:

Ubuntu 16.04 / amdgpu
$ sudo apt-get install amdgpu-pro

Ubuntu 16.04 / Nvidia
$ sudo apt-get install nvidia-open-dev nvidia-361

## Compilation and installation Fabcoin code

Compile and make fabcoin with option --enable-gpu, gpu mining is default disable on makefile.
$ cd ~/fabcoin
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure --enable-gpu
$ make 

 
### Run Mining  
call fabcoind or fabcoin-qt  with option -gen  -G -allgpu will start GPU mining 
  
$ fabcoind \
         -gen \       # -gen will enable mining process. without -G , it will using CPU mining .
         -genproclimit  # Set threads numbers for CPU mining  (-1 = all cores, default 1) .
         -G   \         # -G , Enable GPU mining  (default: false, don't use GPU)
         -device=<id> \ # If -G is enabled this specifies the GPU device number to use(default: 0)
         -allgpu        # If -G is enabled this will mine on all available GPU devices (default: false)
 
example :
$ fabcoind -testnet -daemon -gen -G -allgpu      # start GPU mining on all GPU card on testnet.
